# Hi there!
This is a Github-account for Dennis Kjellin, currently a student at Mittuniversitetet in Sundsvall Sweden. The program im attending is Web-development. Here I will post my work and you can look att my different projects and see me develop and advancing my skills in the web-development field!

## Short info
During my studies I work extra at Jack & Jones were I have worked as a assistant store manager for about 11 years now. I am also employed at Mittuniversitetet Sundsvall as a 'assigment supervisor' for the students that studdies the first year of web-development program, where I help students with their assigments and help them grow the best way I possible can.

I see myself as a person that spreads good energy in life in general and always tries to see things from a positive perspective, I would say thats one of my strengths.
